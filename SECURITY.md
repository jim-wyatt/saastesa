## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it privately and do **not** open a public issue or pull request.

### How to report

- Use this repository's **GitHub Security Advisories** feature:
  - Go to the repository page.
  - Click the **Security** tab.
  - Click **Report a vulnerability** and follow the instructions.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories for any reason, you may instead
contact the maintainers via email (for example, using the contact information
listed in the project README or maintainers file) and include:

- A clear description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or configuration details.

### What to expect

- We aim to acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
- After acknowledgement, we will provide updates at least every **14 days**
  while we investigate and work on a fix.
- If we confirm the vulnerability, we will work to release a fix and may
  coordinate a disclosure date with you.
- If we determine that the reported issue is not a vulnerability, we will
  explain our reasoning as clearly as possible.
